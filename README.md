### Hi, Olivia Here ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm a full stack developer, based in Seattle, WA. 

After 5 years working in finance&accounting, I realized how tech is disrupting the traditional industry, driving greater efficiency, security, automation and etc. I'm passionate about revolutionization. Previously, I got chance to work closely with software developer team as a Domain Specialist. Thus, I decided to make a career change to become a SWE. :woman_technologist:

:rocket: My passion for software lies with endless opportunities for innovation and problem-solving, creating software applications and systems that can make a difference on individuals and community, as well as continuously learn and adapt to new technologies. 

Always learning, and always open to opportunities.
